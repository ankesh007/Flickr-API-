The program makes call to Flickr API and saves public image URL, number of views of image and total count of uploads of user in a CSV file.

The above has been written in node js and has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04.

The program pulls ~1500 different images every hour without violating FlickrAPI regulations.

If running the program for the first time,run
./submit.sh

For further running, use 
./runFinal.sh


You may need to give execute permission to the script, so if any error comes on executing above command, do:
chmod +x submit.sh
chmod +x runFinal.sh


FlickCall is the file where you can play with the parameters.
To run the file, type,
./run.sh
