The program makes call to Flickr API and saves public image URL, number of views of image and total count of uploads of user in a CSV file.

The above has been written in node js and has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04.

**This program is not scheduled. For scheduled version, change branch to scheduling.

As the program is not scheduled, its suggested to keep the pull parameters low, in order not to violate API regulation (3600 hits/hour)

If running the program for the first time,run
./submit.sh

For further running, use 
./run.sh


You may need to give execute permission to the script, so if any error comes on executing above command, do:
chmod +x submit.sh
chmod +x run.sh
